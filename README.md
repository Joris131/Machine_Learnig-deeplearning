## supervised learning

### regression problem & classification problem

#### Gradient Descent Algorithm/"Batch" Greadient Descent Algorithm, a linear regression algorithm

#### Normal Equation, another type of algorithm to subtitiute gradient descent when the features are in a small number.

##### Normal Equation in non-invertible circumstances which normally have two:
###### Redundant Features
###### Too many features
##### However, it seems like we don't need to worry about this problem because some algorithm/methods are adopted by sofeware like octiave to solve this.

## unsupervised learning (the judge/standard is not set but you but the machine/computer)

### clustering is one of the types of classification problem.
